# Neomake Autolint

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dojoteef/neomake-autolint/master/doc/neomake-autolint.gif)

Neomake Autolint leverages [Neomake]'s ability to asynchronously run linters on
a file. It augments that functionality with the ability to run file level
linters as you type so you get the most immediate feedback. This requires your
version of [Vim] or [Neovim] to support job control, otherwise the plugin will
be disabled. Thanks goes out to the team of Neomake for making a great plugin!

## Requirements

Since Neomake Autolint is built upon [Neomake] the requirements for Neomake
Autolint are the same as [Neomake]'s requirements for async support. While it
may be possible to use this plugin without async support by setting
*g:neomake_autolint_enabled* manually it is not something that will be actively
supported.

For more details see [Neomake's requirements](https://github.com/neomake/neomake#requirements).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Neomake Autolint is not working.

There are a small number of issues that could cause Neomake Autolint to be
disabled. 

First verify that [Neomake] is installed. Neomake Autolint depends on Neomake
so if it is not installed Neomake Autolint will not work.

Neomake Autolint needs to be installed as a plugin to Neomake. If Neomake was
installed first, it may need to be uninstalled and reinstalled with Autolint. This
is the case with vim-plug. Simply appending ` | Plug 'dojoteef/neomake-autolint' `
to `Plug 'neomake/neomake'` and running `:PlugInstall` will **not** produce a working
installation.

Check if your version of vim supports jobs and timers. You can verify this by
typing: `:echo has('nvim') || has('job') && has('timers')`

If you do not have job-control and still desire to run Neomake Autolint you
can override the default behavior by setting `g:neomake_autolint_enabled` to
1.

Another issue that could cause Neomake Autolint to be disabled is a missing
cache directory. In order to run a linter over the currently edited file it
needs to be saved to disk. Neomake Autolint saves those temporary files in the
directory as specified in `g:neomake_autolint_cachedir`. Please verify the
cache directory exists.

### Can the sign column always be displayed?

See `g:neomake_autolint_sign_column_always` in the plugin documentation.
