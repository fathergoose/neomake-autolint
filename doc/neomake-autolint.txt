==============================================================================
1. Introduction                                 *neomake-autolint-introduction*

Neomake Autolint leverages Neomake's ability to asynchronously run linters on
a file. It augments that functionality with the ability to run file level
linters as you type so you get the most immediate feedback. This requires your
version of (Neo)vim to support job control, otherwise the plugin will be
disabled. Thanks goes out to the team of Neomake for making a great plugin!

==============================================================================
2. Configuration                               *neomake-autolint-configuration*

There are only a few configuration options for Neomake Autolint. For most
setups there should be very little you need to explicitly configure to use the
plugin.

Global Options                                       *neomake-autolint-options*

*g:neomake_autolint_enabled*
By default Neomake Autolint is only enabled if Neomake has asynchronous job
support which makes the lint as you type approach work without constant
pauses. If you want it to be enabled whether you have asynchronous job support
or not just set this to 1.

*g:neomake_autolint_cachedir*
Where to cache temporary files used for linting unwritten buffers. Defaults to
checking for |$XDG_CACHE_HOME| then |$HOME|/.cache. If no valid cache
directory can be found the plugin will be disabled.

*g:neomake_autolint_updatetime*
The number of milliseconds to wait before running another Neomake lint over
the file. Default to 500.

*g:neomake_autolint_sign_column_always*
Whether to keep the sign column showing all the time. If you find it annoying
that the sign column flashes open/closed during autolinting set this to 1.
Defaults to 0.

==============================================================================
3. Commands                                         *neomake-autolint-commands*

*:NeomakeAutolintToggle* *:NeomakeAutolintToggle!*
Running |:NeomakeAutolintToggle| will toggle Neomake Autolint on/off for the
specified buffer (defaults to the current buffer), while the command
|:NeomakeAutolintToggle!| will do that for all buffers.

4. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)                      *neomake-autolint-faq*

4.1 Neomake Autolint is not working.~

There are a small number of issues that could cause Neomake Autolint to be
disabled. 

First verify that Neomake (https://github.com/neomake/neomake) is installed.
Neomake Autolint depends on Neomake so if it is not installed Neomake Autolint
will not work.

Additionally, Neomake Autolint needs to be installed as a plugin to Neomake. If Neomake was
installed first, it may need to be uninstalled and reinstalled with Autolint. This
is the case with vim-plug. Simply appending ` | Plug 'dojoteef/neomake-autolint' `
to `Plug 'neomake/neomake'` and running `:PlugInstall` will **not** produce a working
installation.

Check if your version of vim supports jobs, see |job-control| and
|timer_start()|. You can verify
this by typing: >

  :echo has('nvim') || has('job') && has('timers')
<
If you do not have |job-control| and still desire to run Neomake Autolint you
can override the default behavior by setting |g:neomake_autolint_enabled| to
1.

Another issue that could cause Neomake Autolint to be disabled is a missing
cache directory. In order to run a linter over the currently edited file it
needs to be saved to disk. Neomake Autolint saves those temporary files in the
directory as specified in |g:neomake_autolint_cachedir|. Please verify the
cache directory exists.

4.2 Can the sign column always be displayed?~

See |g:neomake_autolint_sign_column_always| (press `<C-]>` on the link to go there).
